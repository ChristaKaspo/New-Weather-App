#New Weather App

A simple weather app that communicates to an API. If you are looking to create one please visit openweatherapp.org, create an account, and get an API key! (Always remember to put it inside of a secrets folder) :)

## Installation

You can start from scratch. I used create-react-app!
Run npm install to start off if you're cloning this.


## Contributing
